# Public Communications SOP

This is the rough communications SOP. As of 5th Aug, Daniel is doing this job.

## Process

Every sprint cycle (2 weeks), we will need to:

1. Post Financial Update on Github ([see template](https://github.com/enabledao/enable/issues/119)), including treasury balances.

2. Send Update Email to mailing list followers ([see example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12fkvVFYOyQ52TIISj7aqDu-41ZqX7nY0DDEHfjHRfeQ/edit?usp=sharing))

This should be similar to Loom's weekly update emails, whose format I really like.

3. Post summary of Update Email on Twitter ([see example]())

## Accounts

We have a Twitter account at @enablecredit that we have not fully set up yet

We have a Mailchimp account for our email list, Daniel has the login.

## Best Practices

It's fastest to draft the update email in Mailchimp, instead of Google Docs. Mailchimp has its own editor, which does not let you easily import emails.
