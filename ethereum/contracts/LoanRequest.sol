/*
    Differences from crowdsale: Rather than paying with ether, you pay with the token of choice.
    You must approve before calling.

    The fallback function just refunds - we don't accept ether here. (Need to evaluate re-entrancy)

    So we may have to override huge parts of it, but we'll see
