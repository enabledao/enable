## Summary


We are building a reusable **crowdfunded Dai loan kit**. This uses smart contracts to allow a borrower to borrow from and repay many lenders in Dai. The smart contract will keep track of fractional loan ownership and accounting.

This will be a proof-of-concept "n=1" fundraise for a single loan for a single borrower, and released as a reusble kit. This is the first step towards

## Business Case

We are using Ines' need to raise 60,000 Dai to pay for her Cornell degree to drive our business use case. The success state is her being able to raise the amount from lender, and successfully pay back the loan over 12 months.

## User Story

### Personas

* `Borrower`

* `Potential Lender`: (many) visit the crowdfunding page, and

* `Lender`: (many) owns fractional shares of the loan, giving them right to repayment

* `Operator`: the operator of the loan contract


### Step 1: Loan Creation
1. Borrower creates an on-chain loan request by committing to a set of loan terms (i.e. princpal amount, interest, time period). Borrower supplies a writeup and a video explaining the fundraise that is stored off-chain.
2. This creates a Kiva or GoFundMe-style crowdfunding page UI. Potential lenders can view the loan request and see the projected repayment table.

### Step 2: Loan Crowdfunding
4. Lender starts the lending process by filling out their details (for KYC) through a web form.
5. Lender chooses their funding amount in Dai.
6. The UI should check whether the lender has sufficient Dai available.
7. The UI should also check whether the lent amount would exceed the fundraising amount, and advise the lender to lower the amount.
8. The UI should also show the simulated repayment schedule, and lender's profit from the loan.
9. **[To discuss]** Lender has the option of opting to have a video interview with the borrower
10. Lender uses Metamask to transfer the Dai amount to the loan contract.

## Loan State

### States of loan

1. On time
2. Late (within 30 days)
3. Default (past 180 days)

## Roadmap

### Our constraints

1. We only have a small volunteer team of 2-3 software engineers
2. Open source allowance is $5k a month spread out across team
3. Want to avoid wasteful work, need to validate smallest idea first (e.g. on-chain P2P loans)
5. Need to devote time to test coverage to prevent hacks

### Features pushed to future releases

1. **"Marketplace"**: we are focused on a single loan. We need to validate this idea before we support for multiple loans + new loans.

3. **Tradeable debt tokens**: this increases (significantly) the surface area for attacks

4. **Collateralized loans**: current business case does not allow for this

5. **Sophisticated loan calculations**: this covers mortgage-style "PMT" loan calculations, grace periods, time-based interest penalties.
