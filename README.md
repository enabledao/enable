# Enable

Enable is a “Kiva for Dai” that allows lenders to make peer-to-peer stablecoin microloans to emerging market borrowers. Our first product is a [peer-to-peer crowdloan kit](https://github.com/enabledao/enable/blob/master/product/specs/2019-07-14-v0.1-specs-(ines)/v0.1-specs.md).

We are an open source volunteer project that grew out of the [open finance hackathon](https://www.buildandship.it/) in May 2019. We are currently funded by a [3-month grant](https://twitter.com/onggunhao/status/1148140687327555584) from [Binance Labs](https://labs.binance.com/).

This repo is mainly for project management and product-related discussions. See our workstreams for development work.

| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Operational Costs | Incurs forex, transfer and bank fees as it goes through the cross-border banking system                        | **$0**, uses stablecoins                           |
| Accounting Effort | Team of diligent accountants required to manage fractional loan ownership and allocation of repayments streams | **0 headcount**, automated through smart contracts |
| Transparency      | Loan repayment data is usually opaque or subject to time delays                                                | **Fully transparent ledger**                       |
| Composability     | Investment bankers, auditors, legal contracts required to package it into derivatives (e.g. bonds, CLOs)       | **Fully programmable smart contract**              |

## Future Directions

* Debt Tokens
* Marketplace
* Collateralized loans: identity-collateralized loans
* Sophisticated loan types: PMT
* Sophisticated payment tracking
* interest rate auctions
* Derivative products (e.g. collateralized loan obligations) to try to create investment-grade products
